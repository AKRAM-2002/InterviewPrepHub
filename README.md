# InterviewPrepHub

### Overview

- InterviewPrepHub is an open-source repository aimed at helping developers prepare for software engineering interviews. The repository provides a comprehensive collection of mock interview questions, coding challenges, system design scenarios, and behavioral questions, organized by topic and difficulty level. This repository also allows users to contribute their own examples, test cases, and solutions, creating a collaborative and ever-growing resource.

Our goal is to create a community-driven platform where interview preparation is practical, accessible, and aligned with real-world interview scenarios, including FAANG and startup-specific questions.
