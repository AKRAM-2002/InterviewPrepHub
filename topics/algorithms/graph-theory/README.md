# Graph Theory

Graph theory is a crucial concept in computer science, especially for problems that involve traversal, connectivity, and exploring relationships between entities. Below are key concepts and problems to help you understand and apply graph theory in coding challenges.

## Key Concepts:
- **Graph**: A graph consists of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). It can be directed or undirected.
- **DFS and BFS**: Graph traversal algorithms. DFS goes deep, while BFS explores level by level.
- **Connected Components**: Subgraphs where all nodes are connected.
- **Cycles**: Paths where a node can reach itself.
