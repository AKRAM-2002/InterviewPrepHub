# Stacks data structure Python

File I/O (Input/Output) is essential for working with files in Python. It enables reading, writing, and manipulating data stored in files, allowing you to process large datasets, store logs, or manage configuration files.

This section covers basic to advanced file operations in Python and provides interview questions and exercises to build your expertise.
