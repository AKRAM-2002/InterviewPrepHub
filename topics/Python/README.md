# Python Concepts: Interview Preparation and Practical Exercises

Welcome to the **Python** folder! This collection is designed to help you strengthen your understanding of essential Python concepts through targeted interview questions and practical exercises. Each topic is organized into its own folder, providing focused resources to aid in mastering file handling, signal processing, data management, regular expressions, and more.

## Topics Overview

1. **File I/O in Python**
   - Learn how to handle file operations efficiently, including reading, writing, and processing files line-by-line without loading them entirely into memory.
   - [Go to File I/O](File_IO/README.md)

2. **Signal Handling in Python**
   - Understand signal handling to manage program interruptions and graceful shutdowns.
   - [Go to Signal Handling](Signal_Handling/README.md)

3. **Data Processing**
   - Explore methods to parse, analyze, and organize data, particularly from log files or text-based data.
   - [Go to Data Processing](Data_Processing/README.md)

4. **Regular Expressions**
   - Practice using regex to search, match, and extract patterns in text.
   - [Go to Regular Expressions](Regular_Expressions/README.md)

5. **Dictionaries in Python**
   - Master dictionaries for storing, counting, and managing data.
   - [Go to Dictionaries](Dictionaries/README.md)

6. **Exception Handling**
   - Improve error handling for robust and resilient Python code.
   - [Go to Exception Handling](Exception_Handling/README.md)

## Combined Task: Real-Time Log Processing

Once youâ€™ve explored each concept, try out the **Combined Task** integrating multiple skills:
- **Assignment**: Write a Python script to process logs in real-time, categorize file sizes by status codes, and handle interruptions.
- **Skills**: This task requires File I/O, Signal Handling, Data Processing, Regular Expressions, Dictionaries, and Exception Handling.

## How to Use this Folder

Each topic folder contains:
- **README.md**: Introduces the topic, provides interview questions, and lists exercises to practice.
- **code_samples/**: A directory to store sample solutions and reference code for each topic.

Start with any concept, review the questions, and complete exercises to solidify your understanding. Good luck, and happy coding!
